==================================================================================================
		_staticcoords give you the possibility to organize your crashsites!

		Crashsites close to cherno or electro would be possible with that.
		Use the editor for your map, create some vehicles or triggers at points where you
		want your crashside (aprox), save it and extract all coordinates and put them in this
		2D-Array. If you dont know how to do this, dont use _staticcoords.

		I would advise you to create at least 100 positions, otherwise its too easy for your players
		to find the crash-locations after some time of playing on your server.

		!!!!!After you put in the coordinates you have to set _useStatic to true inside
		your server_monitor.sqf, default is false!!!!!
